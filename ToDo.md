Nice work on this application! Nice use of icons/images within the app. For view, no need to show the "lorem ipsum" text. It is supposed to show all the employees/contacts. More useful if they are hidden whenever showing a form but your forms changed above the list which I liked. Good work.

One thing to consider (no points taken off for this): when comparing the name of the employee from your list and the input value, use the method .toLowerCase to change the values to the same case. This way, if the user types 'SARAH', "sarah', or "sARah" they will all match to "Sarah" when turned to lowercase; makes for a better user experience.

remove Lorem, add case change stuff
